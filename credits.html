  <strong>(R to L)</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Joy Grünklee	Team Lead, css page architect, bug chaser, and the glue that held us together.<br>
  <em>(also, amazingly, familiarized herself Bootstrap js libraries the night before the hackathon.)</em></p>

<p>Bill Paxton	Handled divs and page styling, collaborative bug chasing with Joy<br>
<em>(after learning Bootstrap from Joy in the first 45 minutes of the hackathon, also Bootstrap guy.)</em>

<p>Jeff Bravo	Handled version control, managed merge conflicts. Put up repo and Bootstrap starter page.<br>
<em>(also the miscellany you see… graphics, icons, managing repos and solid maybe.github.io hosting)</em></p>

<p>Jason Aldosa	Handled much of the js heavy lifting for us<br>
<em>Quietly coded and debugged with us for 8 hours. Smiled some times. Might be an introvert.</em></p>
<br>

<p>At the end of the day, we had a working app and couldn’t believe how fast the day just flew by.</p>

<p>The other big surprise, was that after presenting with 14 other teams, being selected 3rd place in the hackathon for our work on the soldMaybe Weather App: <a href="http://solidmaybe.github.io/weather" target="new">http://solidmaybe.github.io/weather</a></p>

<p>Go team! Solid credit to our Lead, Joy (the glue that held us together, who recognized our individual strengths and let us each do what we do best… and helping us out when we need it… <em>Thank you, Joy.</em>) And solid credit to our team members, who together, came together and created something wonderful (more than just the app we presented at the end of the day.) <em>— Jeff</em>
